# Weather application

It's a small application to geocode your location and get the forecast right in console. 

I created it during Node.js course by [Andrew Mead](https://github.com/andrewjmead). 

Here are some modules I used in my [Weather Website](https://github.com/eugene-maximenko/Weather-Website)

## Getting Started

Download this repository on your machine, download all needed npm packages using `npm i` and hit `npm run dev`, so the project will run on your localhost.
